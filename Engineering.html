	<p>The built environment envelopes society. It is the foundation for all human interaction, exploration, and achievement. The built environment lets you travel from home to work, and then back safely. It helps you breathe clean air, drink clean water, and sleep peacefully while the winds stirs outside. The built environment houses humanity it the tallest buildings, and carries them on the steepest roller coasters. The built environment is the foundation for humanity's very being</p>
	<p>For me, the infrastructure which cradles society inspires MY very being. I yearn to design, build, and innovate FOR society. I believe that it is at the pinnacle of my empathy and due diligence towards others than I serve mankind through the function of civil engineering.</p>
	<p>My name is Irteza Nahiyan Ahmed. And this is my life</p>
